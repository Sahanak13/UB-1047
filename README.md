# Certificate Auth

Simple Node.js certificate verification demo.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start server:

```bash
node server.js
```

3. Open `public/index.html` in your browser (or visit http://localhost:3000 if the server binds to that port).

## Notes
- Uploads are stored in the `uploads/` folder.
- `certificates.json` contains certificate data used by the app.
